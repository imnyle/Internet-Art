       "it is on the Internet that our confrontations with technology as it collides with our sense of human identity are fresh and even raw. In the real-time communities of cyberspace, we are dwellers on the threshold between the real and virtual, unsure off our footing, inventing ourselves as we go along.”

    <marquee class="lyrics">Wasted, wasted in a cyber dimension
Pour my heart into simulation
Teach each other reciprocation
I'm staring at the screen that you live in (あのひと)
I'm trying to remember your name then
The memory before I awaken
Is coded to a million fragments
But all I had was pixel affection
Pixel affection
Pixel affection
Pixel affection
Pixel affection (あのひと)
Shadows follow me and I let them
I wanna leave the world I was left in (あのひと)
Unstable online interconnection
I'm trying to remember your name then (あのひと)
The memory before I awaken
Is coded to a million fragments
Consuming all the bones I have broken
But all I had was pixel affection
