        <p>welcome to my zine!
            <br>
            This project is all about exploring how queer identity manifests on the internet, and how artists explore those ideas.</p>
            <p>I collected quotes and artwork that resonate with this vision and put them together in this sort of quasi-ethnography of the queer internet artist. This zine follows 1 artist on her movement through using technology as an expression of self. through their journey, we meet other artists and scholars who expound on those same principles and their role in queer life.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy!</p>
