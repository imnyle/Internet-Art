    The turn to the internet and personas for many queer people comes from the queerphobia and isolation many experience in the waking world. But perhaps a rejection of the human body isn’t the answer. <b>Artist 3, Noah Holtegaard</b>, is a trans-masculine nonbinary Danish artist who focuses on an embrace of fundamental aspects of human culture and using technology to make them queer centric. His work explores technology as a medium for building utopia and folklore, creating the history and optimism queer people have been robbed of.

    Imagining Utopias has long been a form of personal and cultural resistance, an idea exemplified by Bjork (an icon in the queer community) on her "Utopia" album, a perfect musical compliment to the the themes we're exploring.
