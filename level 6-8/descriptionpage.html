<br>
<br>
This project is all about exploring how queer identity manifests on the internet, and how artists explore those ideas.
<br>
<br>
I collected <b>quotes and artwork</b> that resonate with this vision and put them together in this sort of quasi-ethnography of the queer internet artist. This zine follows 1 artist on her movement through using <b>technology as an expression of self.</b> through their journey, we meet other artists and scholars who expound on those same principles and their role in queer life.

I hope you enjoy!
